summary: Control a raspberry pi fan attached to a GPIO
description: |
  Control a fan attached to a GPIO via NPN transistor
  (defaults to GPIO 14 (pin 8))

  MAke sure to connect the snap interface for the correct GPIO
  that your fan is attached to (see https://pinout.xyz for correct mapping)

      snap connect pi-fancontrol:gpio pi:bcm-gpio-14

  The snap allows a few configurations to be set

  Pick a different GPIO to swithc the fan on/off (do not forget to use the
  above connect command to enable access to this changed GPIO)

      snap set pi-fancontrol gpio=23
  
  Set the temperature threshold (in degrees celsius) at which the
  fan turns on

      snap set pi-fancontrol threshold=40

  Set the interval (in seconds) at which the temperature gets scanned

      snap set pi-fancontrol interval=60
